I'm *IT guy/SysAdmin/DevOps guy* who tries to learn [everything at once all the time](@root/cv//).

I forked and maintain [Quake 3 Arena OSP server docker image](https://github.com/wokoman/docker-quake3-osp-server).

My humble website is running on [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) webserver behind [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) with full HSTS thing going on, and it's built with [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy) using [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). It's all containerized and running using [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) on Ubuntu VPS.
