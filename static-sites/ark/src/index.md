I'm a *DevOps guy* who tries to learn [everything at once, all the time](@root/cv//).

Now I make my living with hyperscalers, Kubernetes, GitOps, pipelines, automation — you name it.

I once forked a [Quake 3 server docker image](https://github.com/wokoman/docker-quake3-osp-server) and *tried to* maintain it (still works tho™).

Based in Prague. Dad of two. Trying to play videogames.
