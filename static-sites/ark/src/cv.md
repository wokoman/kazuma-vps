- ***[Download my resume](@root/CV_en.pdf)***

I have production experience with all three major clouds, running workloads almost exclusively on their **Kubernetes** distributions. These are packaged as **Helm** charts and deployed via **Argo CD** using *GitOps*.

Most of my time is spent writing **Terraform** or **OpenTofu**.

I know **GitHub Actions** best — its powers and limitations — but I've also spent a long time with **GitLab**.

I'm most comfortable in **Python** and currently working on my **Go**. I've dabbled with **Rust**, but it's still a bit over my head. Of course, I know **Bash**.

I leverage LLMs as a tool that lets me focus on finding the best solution rather than hunting for syntax. I identify with this post on [Zed's Blog](https://zed.dev/blog/on-programming-with-agents).
