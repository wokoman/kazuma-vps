# Kazuma VPS

This is a repo with for my Kubernetes resources and [my personal page](https://michalkozak.cz).

It's operated the GitOps-way through **ArgoCD**.

As of now, there is:

- *Ark* for generating my page
- *Caddy* for a webserver
- *Miniflux* for RSS reading
- *Traefik* for ingress

There's a *GitHub Action* YAML, that updates my page whenever I change one of the sources for it.

I also need a blog. Maybe.
