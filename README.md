# Kazuma VPS

This is a repo with for my Kubernetes resources and my personal page.

As of now, this is used:

- *Caddy* for a webserver
- *Ivy* for generating my page
- ~~*Grafana* and *Graphite & StatsD* for playing around~~
- ~~*Planka* as a Trello wannabe~~
- ~~*PostgreSQL* for Planka~~
- ~~*Praqma* for debugging~~
- *Traefik* for ingress

There's a *GitHub Action* YAML, that updates my page whenever I change one of the sources for it.

*Ansible* playbook in this repo is a echo of a past, when I was provisioning one's VM.

~~I'll redone this for ArgoCD/Flux, I promise.~~ I'm redoing it with ArgoCD right now, I promise.

I also need a blog. Maybe.
